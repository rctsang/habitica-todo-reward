# Habitica Todo Reward

This is essentially a copy of the [Double-reward](https://github.com/festeh/Double-reward) project but deployed on Heroku. Like Double-reward, it receives item completion notifications from Todoist via webhook, then creates and completes a Habitica task in response. 

This only runs as a personal developer app right now and I don't really have plans to make it prettier. If you'd like to set it up for yourself, see instructions below.

## Setup

This application requires a free Todoist account, a free Habitica account, and a free Heroku account, as well as the Heroku Command Line Tools. 

Find the the Habitica and Todoist API tokens under your account settings. In Todoist it should be under "Settings >> Integrations" and in Habitica it should be in "Settings >> API". 

#### Configuring Todoist Webhooks

You will need to configure your Todoist account to generate webhooks. You can do this by creating an app in the [Todoist App Management Console](https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html) and setting the webhooks callback url to be the url generated by `heroku create` with the route `/todoist_item_completed`. Check the "item:completed" checkbox and save your settings. This should be (?) all you need to do. 

#### Setting up Heroku Environment

Grab the API tokens, as well as your Habitica User ID and save them as environment variables. Locally I did this in a `.env` file, but on Heroku you need to use `heroku config:set <VAR>=<value>`. 
e.g.
```
heroku config:set HABITICA_USER_ID=<your habitica user id>
heroku config:set HABITICA_API_TOKEN=<your habitica api token>
heroku config:set TODOIST_API_TOKEN=<your todoist api token>
```

The `Procfile` starts gunicorn and tells it what to do. (more settings can also be configured here) (i think)
The `requirements.txt` and `runtime.txt` file are used by the heroku dyno to install dependencies and select the language of execution. You shouldn't need to mess with them. 
gunicorn will run `wsgi.py` based on the `Procfile` and start the app.

#### Setting up Redis on Heroku

In order to prevent handling the same webhook twice, we use Redis to impemlent something like a job queue that keeps track of current and completed jobs. (in the same list).

Essentially following the instructions [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-redis). 

Adding a new Redis hobby (free) instance to Heroku (you will need to add a credit card on Heroku. it shouldn't be charged)
```
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev -a <app name>
```

Wait for the Redis server to finish creating. You can check progress with
```
heroku addons:info <addon name>
```

When it's done, it will create an environment variable named `REDIS_URL` which is the url to the created Redis server. It can be accessed from code. You can check the variable value with
```
heroku config | grep REDIS
```
Don't hard-code the url, heroku servers can change the link without warning. Always grab it from `REDIS_URL`

Note: on the free plan, Redis data does not persist between restarting dynos, so if the dyno shuts down, you'll lose your data. This is fine for me as I just need a way to keep track of what jobs are being completed (particularly on startup, which takes time and causes Todoist to send a second webhook)

#### Deploying to Heroku

Once you've set the environment variables you can create the app on heroku and deploy it.
Heroku deploys project via git, so make sure you have a git repo set up for the project.
```
heroku create <app name>
git push heroku master
```

That should be it. Try checking off an item and Todoist and after about a minute, you should receive the rewards in Habitica (refesh the page to see it)

## Application Notes

| Todoist Priority | Habitica Difficulty |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Hard |
| 2 | Medium |
| 3 | Easy |
| 4 | Easy |

Note: Trivial is not used because I'm lazy and by default Todoist sets all tasks to priority 4. If it's not important it should just be easy, not trivial.

## Heroku Command Line Interface

General Commands:
```
heroku create <app name> 		# creates an app on heroku at https://<app name>.herokuapp.com/ (only done once)
git push heroku master 			# deploy master branch on heroku
heroku ps:scale web=1			# check that at least one app instance is running
heroku open			# opens the generated url
heroku logs --tail 		# view request logs (Crtl+C to quit)
```
Configuring Environment Variables:
```
heroku config 		# lists environment variables
heroku config:get <VAR>			# print value of <VAR>
heroku config:set <VAR>=<value> 		# add or set <VAR> to <value>
heroku config:unset <VAR> 		# remove 
```
